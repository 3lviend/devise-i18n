## 1.6.3

- Updated ar, ca, da, de, es, es-MX, fr, is, it, lv, ro, and ru translations.

## 1.6.1

- Added sq translation.
- Updated cs, de-CH, es, fr, ja, nl, sv, zh-CN, and zh-TW translations.

## 1.6.0

- Added and updated English strings to match those in devise 4.4.0.
- Require devise 4.4 and above.

## 1.5.1

- Devise looks up a different key on login failure if the user exists. This can be used by other users to determine if specific user is already registered, even if Devise is in paranoid mode (which normally tries to prevent this). This has been filed as [devise issue #4763](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise/issues/4763). Updated some translations that were using different strings for these keys to mitigate the issue.
- Updated de, el, es, et, fa, ja, nl, pl, pt-BR, ru, si, sv, vi, and zh-CN translations.

## 1.5.0

- Require devise 3.4 and above.
- Updated error keys to use the devise-configured authentication keys instead of always "email" or translated equivalent (feature introduced in [devise#3201](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise/issues/3201)).
- Added si translation.
- Updated de, el, fi, fr, pl, pt-BR, zh-CN, and zh-TW translations.

## 1.4.0

- Add a requirement for devise 3.1 and above.
- Removed backwards compatibility for mailer tokens for devise versions before 3.1.0. Any views generated into your app prior to this release of devise-i18n should continue to work. If, for some reason, you are otherwise calling `DeviseI18n::ViewHelpers` methods (`resource_confirmation_token`, `resource_reset_password_token`, and `resource_unlock_token`), you will need to replace these calls with `@token`.
- Update ja translation.

## 1.3.0

## 1.0.0

- Code and translations from [devise-i18n-views](https://github.com/mcasimir/devise-i18n-views) has been merged into devise-i18n. This means that devise-i18n will now also include i18n for the views that devise provides. You will no longer need devise-i18n-views going forward.
